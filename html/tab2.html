<h5>Observed behavior</h5>
<p align="left">
  In my opinion, I think that the data from the plot is variable because in some
  months, such as November and January, they were months which KWH increased as
  159 and 163, but in December decrese a little bit as 152 KWH while in months
  like February and March that this numbers decrease a lot as 143 and 142 KWH
</p>
<h5>Relation among the dots regarding the colors</h5>
<p align="left">
  I think that the relation among the dots regarding the colors is mostly is the ralation of the lineal regression and the dots because this line is used to predict the value of a variable as from others variables, also this line pass for the relation of the KWH data.
</p>
<b><p> 
  values of the next month
</p></b>
<p>
$$ y=(-4.30)(6) + 164.70= 138.9 $$
        <p>
          R=/It is estimated that next month 138.9 KWH will consume.
        </p>
    <b><p> 
      conclusion
    </p></b>
  <p align="left">
      For me I think that we can reduce energy doing simple things such as: turn off the lights when we are not in the room, be careful when washing clothes because the washing machine consume a lot of energy an is the same situation whit the television, fridge.
      Also we have to think in the bad consequences that our unconsciousness do, because we are not the unique affected also is the environment, if we took awareness the world can be best.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
  I observe that in the graph the regression increases as the number of residents also increases, and I consider that this occurs because the more people there may be more energy consumption.</p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      $$ y=(20.08)(200) + 71.68= 138.9 $$
              <p>
                R=/It is estimated that next month 138.9 KWH will consume.
              </p>
        
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
</ul>
