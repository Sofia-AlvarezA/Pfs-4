<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
  <p align="left">
    When we observe the graphic , we can realize that in the regression there is
    a notable increase between the variables over the months, this is due to the
    fact that there have been different variations in the energy consumption in
    Kwh. For example, in month one the value of the "true consume" of energy was
    high, however in month 2 there was a great decrease, but what the other
    months have in common is that the energy in Kwh began to increase and
    regressions too.
  </p>
  <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
  <p align="left">
    The relation is that depending on where the red dots are located, taking
    into account their data and how they vary, the regression is formed.
    Regarding the graph we can notice that the variables of the red dots are
    scattered, but their values are not very far apart, only month two is the
    one that represents the lowest consumption of energy kWh compared to the
    other months.
  </p>
  <b><p> 
      values of the next month
    </p></b>
    <p>
    $$ y=(1.80)(6) + 107.40= 118.2 $$
            <p>
              R=/It is estimated that next month 138.9 KWH will consume.
            </p>
    </li>
    <b><p> 
      conclusion
    </p></b>
  <p align="left">
    I believe that the best way to save or have more stable energy is to use it when it is necessary, because many times we leave lights on or electronic devices that we are not using connected, for example, televisions, computers, microwaves, and many other things that cause unnecessary energy waste. We can also make the most of natural light and try to reduce the use of all kinds of electrical appliances.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
  <p align="left">
          According to the results that we observe in the graph we deduce that the higher the number of people living in the house, the higher the value of the use or the amount of energy (kWh) that is spent. For this reason the regression also increases and maintains a close relationship with the independent variables.

  <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
  <b><p> 
    values of the next month
  </p></b>
  <p>
    $$ y=(20.08)(200) + 71.68= 4087.68 $$
            <p>
              R=/It is estimated that the energy that will be consumed in a residential unit where $200 people live will be 4087.68$
  </li>
</ul>
